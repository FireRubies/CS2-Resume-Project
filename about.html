<!-- About me paragraph-->
<p>
I was born in California in 1966. From there I rapidly climbed the ranks of society until I arrived at the peak I am at the top of today. My skills include
Dreamweaver, PHP, XCode, SQL, HTML5, JS, CSS, C+, C++, CC#, Python, Ruby on Rails, Fortran, and Cobalt as well as many more. I have a PHD in Computer Science, Medicine, and Psychology
and am fluent in English and I'm currently learning Spanish. I am also the CEO of Google, which you may have heard of.
